# Code Externalization

Write R code in external R scripts, and use `read_chunk()` to read them into the current document.

```{r}
#| cache: false
knitr::read_chunk('113-foo.R')
```

The following two chunks are from the external R script `113-foo.R`:

```{r}
#| label: test-a
```
```{r}
#| label: test-b
```
