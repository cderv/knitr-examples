This demo shows you how to merge the source and output blocks in markdown output. Note **knitr** puts R source and output in separate blocks by default.

```{r}
#| label: test-a
a = 1
a
b = 1:10
write(b, '')
```

See if the chunk option `collapse` works:

```{r}
#| label: test-b
#| ref.label: test-a
#| collapse: true
```

Source and output lived together happily ever in **knitr**.
